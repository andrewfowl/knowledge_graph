"Since 2018, the Company has earned income on fiat funds under an arrangement with the issuer of USDC which was
included in interest income within subscriptions and services revenue. On August 18, 2023, the Company entered into an
updated arrangement with the same counterparty. Pursuant to the arrangement, the Company earns a pro rata portion of income"|data_input/coin/coinbase.pdf|27|53bc890b95f44a468fd4092745665c70
"updated arrangement with the same counterparty. Pursuant to the arrangement, the Company earns a pro rata portion of income
earned on USDC reserves based on the amount of USDC held on each respective partys platform, and from the distribution and
usage of USDC after certain expenses. Revenue derived by the Company from this arrangement is dependent on various factors
including the balance of USDC on the Companys platform, the total market capitalization of USDC, and the prevailing interest
rate environment. The agreement is treated as an executory contract accounted for on an accrual basis. Prior period revenue
recognized under the previous arrangement was reclassified to the stablecoin revenue line within subscription and services
revenue, to conform to current period presentation."|data_input/coin/coinbase.pdf|27|45ffdb5f262542c9ae95b8d8e071b5b6
"Blockchain rewards. Blockchain rewards are primarily comprised of staking revenue, in which the Company participates in networks with proof-of-
stake consensus algorithms through creating or validating blocks on the network using the staking validators that it controls.
Blockchain protocols, or the participants that form the protocol networks, reward users for performing various activities on the
blockchain. The most common form today is participating in proof-of-stake networks, however, there are other consensus
algorithms. The Company considers itself the principal in transactions with the blockchain networks, and therefore presents such
blockchain rewards earned on a gross basis. In exchange for participating in the consensus mechanism of these networks, the
Company recognizes revenue in the form of the native token of the network. Each block creation or validation is a performance
obligation. Revenue is recognized at the point when the block creation or validation is complete and the rewards are transferred
into a digital wallet that the Company controls. Revenue is measured based on the number of tokens received and the fair value"|data_input/coin/coinbase.pdf|28|56d7a6832cb748ffaf5cad1b01169bb9
"into a digital wallet that the Company controls. Revenue is measured based on the number of tokens received and the fair value
of the token at contract inception. Blockchain services offered as part of Coinbase Clouds blockchain infrastructure solutions are
included in other subscription and services revenue. The Companys staking revenue is included within blockchain rewards.
Interest income and corporate interest income.
The Company holds customer custodial funds and cash and cash equivalents at certain third-party banks which earn
interest. Interest income earned from customer custodial funds, cash and cash equivalents and loans is calculated using the
interest method and is not within the scope of Topic 606 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Interest earned on customer
custodial funds and loans is included in interest income within subscription and services revenue. Interest earned on the
Companys corporate cash and cash equivalents is included in corporate interest and other income within other revenue.
Custodial fee revenue. The Company provides a dedicated secure cold storage solution to customers and earns a fee, which is based on a
contractual percentage of the daily value of assets under custody. The fee is collected on a monthly basis. These contracts
typically have one performance obligation which is provided and satisfied over the term of the contracts as customers"|data_input/coin/coinbase.pdf|28|6415bc1cdcfa4df88541d06ca2285198
"typically have one performance obligation which is provided and satisfied over the term of the contracts as customers
simultaneously receive and consume the benefits of the services. The contract may be terminated by a customer at any time,
without incurring a penalty. Customers are billed on the last day of the month during which services were provided, with the
amounts generally being due within thirty days of receipt of the invoice. Accounts receivable from customers for custodial fee
revenue, net of allowance, were $10.0 million and $7.8 million as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
The allowance recognized against these fees was not material for any of the periods presented.
Other subscription and services revenue. Other subscription and services revenue primarily comprises revenue from Coinbase One, Coinbase Cloud, which includes
staking application, delegation, and infrastructure services, Learning Rewards campaign revenue, Prime Financing, and revenue
from other subscription licenses. Generally, revenue from other subscription and services contains one performance obligation,
may have variable and non-cash consideration, and is recognized at a point in time or over the period that services are provided.
Accounts receivable from customers for other subscriptions and services revenue, net of allowance, were $14.6 million and

Risk Factors Summary
Consistent with the foregoing, our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those risks discussed
at length below. These risks include, among others, the following, which we consider our most material risks:
•Our operating results have and will significantly fluctuate, including due to the highly volatile nature of crypto;
•Our total revenue is substantially dependent on the prices of crypto assets and volume of transactions conducted on our
platform. If such price or volume declines, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely

•Our net revenue may be concentrated in a limited number of areas. Within transaction revenue and subscription and
services revenue, a meaningful concentration is from transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum and stablecoin revenue in
connection with USDC, respectively. If revenue from these areas declines and is not replaced by new demand for crypto
assets or other products and services, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely
affected;
•We have in the past, and may in the future, enter into partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, or strategic alliances
with third parties. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining strategic relationships with these third parties or if
these third parties fail to deliver certain operational services, our business, operating results, and financial condition

Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are unaudited. These unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and in managements
opinion, reflect all the adjustments, consisting only of normal, recurring adjustments, that are necessary for the fair statement of
the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods presented. The unaudited condensed consolidated
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the full year or any other period.
These condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 21, 2023 (the “Annual Report”)."|data_input/coin/coinbase.pdf|16|c126af561c8f4d76892864ab83b608be
"December 31, 2022 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 21, 2023 (the “Annual Report”).
These condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The
Companys subsidiaries are entities in which the Company holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights, or
where it exercises control. Certain subsidiaries of the Company have a basis of presentation different from GAAP. For the
purposes of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the basis of presentation of such subsidiaries is
converted to GAAP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
There were no changes to the significant accounting policies or recent accounting pronouncements that were disclosed in
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual
Report, other than as discussed below.
Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified in order to conform with the current period presentation. These
reclassifications have no impact on the Companys previously reported consolidated net loss.

Use of estimates
The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions in the Companys condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Significant estimates and assumptions include the determination of the recognition, measurement, and valuation of current
and deferred income taxes; the fair value of performance stock-based awards issued; the useful lives of long-lived assets; the
impairment of long-lived assets; the valuation of privately-held strategic investments, including impairments; the fair value of
safeguarding customer crypto assets and liabilities; the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business
combinations; the fair value of derivatives and related hedges; assessing the likelihood of adverse outcomes from claims and
disputes; and loss provisions.
Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. To
the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Companys condensed
consolidated financial statements will be affected. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various"|data_input/coin/coinbase.pdf|17|4650f0ea382f412fb0aea3e682330c65
"consolidated financial statements will be affected. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Customer custodial funds and customer custodial cash liabilities
Customer custodial funds represent restricted cash and cash equivalents maintained in segregated Company bank accounts
that are held for the exclusive benefit of customers and deposits in transit from payment processors and financial institutions.
Under GAAP, the balance in these accounts that exceeds customer custodial cash liabilities is presented within cash and cash
equivalents. Customer custodial cash liabilities represent the obligation to return cash deposits held by customers in their fiat
wallets and unsettled fiat deposits and withdrawals. Deposits in transit represent settlements from third-party payment
processors and banks for customer transactions. Deposits in transit are typically received within five business days of the
transaction date. The Company establishes withdrawal-based limits in order to mitigate potential losses by preventing customers
from withdrawing the crypto asset to an external blockchain address until the deposit settles. In certain jurisdictions, deposits in
transit qualify as eligible liquid assets to meet regulatory requirements to fulfill the Companys direct obligations under customer"|data_input/coin/coinbase.pdf|17|155071c000a849efbb70a8277a738a6b
"transit qualify as eligible liquid assets to meet regulatory requirements to fulfill the Companys direct obligations under customer
custodial cash liabilities. The Company restricts the use of the assets underlying the customer custodial funds to meet regulatory
requirements and classifies the assets as current based on their purpose and availability to fulfill the Companys direct obligation
under customer custodial cash liabilities.
Certain jurisdictions where the Company operates require the Company to hold eligible liquid assets, as defined by
applicable regulatory requirements and commercial law in these jurisdictions, equal to at least 100% of the aggregate amount of
all customer custodial cash liabilities. Depending on the jurisdiction, eligible liquid assets can include cash and cash equivalents,
customer custodial funds, and certain other customer receivables. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the
Companys eligible liquid assets were greater than the aggregate amount of customer custodial cash liabilities.

Concentration of credit risk
The Companys cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, customer custodial funds, and accounts and loans receivable
are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and customer custodial funds
are primarily placed with financial institutions which are of high credit quality. The Company invests cash and cash equivalents,
and customer custodial funds primarily in highly liquid, highly rated instruments which are uninsured. The Company may also
have corporate deposit balances with financial institutions which exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance
limit of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any
significant credit risk with respect to these accounts. The Company also holds cash and crypto at crypto trading venues and
performs a regular assessment of these crypto trading venues as part of its risk management process.
The Company held $400.8 million and $861.1 million of USDC as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively. The issuer of USDC reported that, as of September 30, 2023, underlying reserves were held in cash, short-duration"|data_input/coin/coinbase.pdf|18|236a02048de24158b84cd723ee6cfce2
"respectively. The issuer of USDC reported that, as of September 30, 2023, underlying reserves were held in cash, short-duration
U.S. Treasuries, and overnight U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements within segregated accounts for the benefit of USDC
holders.
As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company had two and one counterparties, respectively, who
accounted for more than 10% of the Companys accounts and loans receivable, net. See Note 11. Collateral for details on
collateralization of loans receivable.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, one and no counterparty accounted

Recent accounting pronouncements
Accounting pronouncements pending adoption
On March 28, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-01,
Leases (Topic 842): Common Control Arrangements (“ASU 2023-01”). The amendments in ASU 2023-01 improve current GAAP
by clarifying the accounting for leasehold improvements associated with common control leases, thereby reducing diversity in
practice. Additionally, the amendments provide investors and other allocators of capital with financial information that better
reflects the economics of those transactions. The new standard is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January
1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard."|data_input/coin/coinbase.pdf|18|b22709cb62164217976624721711bb75

On June 30, 2022, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities
Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (“ASU 2022-03”). ASU 2022-03 clarifies that a contractual sale restriction prohibiting the
sale of an equity security is a characteristic of the reporting entity holding the equity security and is not included in the equity
security's unit of account. The standard requires specific disclosures related to equity securities that are subject to contractual
sale restrictions, including (1) the fair value of such equity securities reflected in the balance sheet, (2) the nature and remaining
duration of the corresponding restrictions, and (3) any circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions. The new
standard is effective for the Company for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard.
